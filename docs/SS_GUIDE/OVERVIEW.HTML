<H2>What is SlipScript</H2>
SlipScript is a simple server side scripting language
which gets embedded into an HTML file. When the HTML page is requested,
the script is decoded before the HTML page is displayed. It enables the
author to provided dynamic content and the ability to perform CGI scripting
right on the HTML page. SlipScript currently runs only on Windows 95/NT
with almost any server that accepts CGI.<BR><BR>
