================================================

cgihtml is a collection of CGI parsing and HTML output functions
written in C.  These routines simplify the task of writing CGI
programs in C.

To install, untar the distribution in your cgi-src directory and
type 'make'.  Documentation is in docs/cgihtml.html.  More information
is available on the cgihtml home page at
     <URL:http://hcs.harvard.edu/~eekim/web/cgihtml/>

You can obtain a copy of cgihtml from:
     <URL:ftp://hcs.harvard.edu/pub/web/tools/cgihtml.tar.gz>

For updates and announcements, subscribe to the cgihtml mailing list
by sending e-mail to majordomo@hcs.harvard.edu with the message:

     subscribe cgihtml

For a simple example of how to use cgihtml, look at the source for
query-results.c.
