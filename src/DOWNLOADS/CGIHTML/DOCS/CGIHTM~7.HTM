<h2>5.1. Release notes</h2>

<p>This is the fourth release of my cgihtml.a library.  I am planning
on enhancing this library, and I welcome any comments or suggestions.
Please e-mail them to <a href="mailto:eekim@fas.harvard.edu">
eekim@fas.harvard.edu</a>.</p>

<p>This library is e-mail ware.  Please send me e-mail if you use this
library; I'd really like to hear your comments.  Although I do not
require it, I would appreciate attribution if you use my code.</p>

<h2>5.2. Future releases</h2>

<p>This library is nearing its final release.  I hope to include
cookie support, FastCGI support, and API support (for Apache,
Netscape, and Microsoft servers).  I may also attempt to port it to
the Macintosh, and I want to improve generally portability.  I am
working on some other software that I hope will integrate well with
cgihtml.  Finally, I'd like to improve the robustness and fix all the
bugs.</p>

<p>If you have any suggestions, I'd like to hear them.  Feel free to
e-mail me at
<a href="mailto:eekim@hcs.harvard.edu">eekim@hcs.harvard.edu.</a></p>
