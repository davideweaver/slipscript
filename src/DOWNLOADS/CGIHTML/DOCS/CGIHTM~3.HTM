<h2>1.1. Requirements</h2>

<p>cgihtml was written for Unix machines in C, although it has been
successfully ported to Windows NT, and can probably be ported to other
operating systems.  All you need is a C compiler, and you should be
set.</p>

<p>By default, cgihtml assumes you are installing on a Unix machine with
the CGI source code going in a cgi-src directory and the binaries in a
cgi-bin directory.</p>

<h2>1.2. Obtaining and unpacking the distribution</h2>

<p>You may find cgihtml-1.5.tar.gz at
<a href="ftp://hcs.harvard.edu/pub/web/tools/">
ftp://hcs.harvard.edu/pub/web/tools/</a>.</p>

<p>To unpack the distribution, you must first gunzip it (using the GNU
gzip utility) and then untar it.  Copy the distribution into your CGI
source directory, and try the following commands:</p>

<pre>
     % gzip -d cgihtml-1.5.tar.gz
     % tar -xvf cgihtml-1.5.tar
</pre>

<p>cgihtml is also available in UNIX compressed (.Z) and PKZipped
(.zip) format.</p>

<h2>1.3. Compiling the library</h2>

<p>To compile the library on a UNIX platform, examine the Makefile
and make sure you are satisfied with the variables.  Then type:</p>

<pre>
     % make cgihtml.a
</pre>

<p>This will produce the file cgihtml.a.  To compile the library as well
as all of the example programs, type:</p>

<pre>
     % make all
</pre>

<h3>Configuring File Upload</h3>

<p>By default, the file upload directory is set to /tmp.  To change
this value, uncomment <tt>#-DUPLOADDIR=/tmp</tt> in the Makefile and
replace /tmp with the directory of your choice.</p>

<h3>For NT Users Only</h3>

<p>If you are compiling on Windows NT, uncomment out -DUNIX.  The line
in your Makefile should look like this:</p>

<pre>
   CFLAGS= -g -Wall #-DUNIX
</pre>

<h2>1.4. Porting</h2>

<p>While compiling the libraries on various Unix machines, you may have
trouble with the "ranlib" command.  If you system doesn't seem to have
this command, you most likely don't need.  Set the RANLIB variable in
the Makefile to "true".</p>

<p>If you are attempting to port this library to a non-Unix system,
defining NT at compile time should work, even if you're not using
Windows NT.</p>
