cgihtml is C library for writing Common Gateway Interface (CGI)
programs for use on the World Wide Web (WWW).  It includes routines to
perform form data parsing and HTML output.  These routines greatly
simplify the task of writing CGI programs in C.

This library is public domain.  Includes example programs.

cgihtml was recently named one of the top 2 web tools for CGI
programming by PC Computing (August 1996).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

I highly recommend users of cgihtml v1.21 to upgrade.  There are
several useful bug fixes and improvements in this realize.
